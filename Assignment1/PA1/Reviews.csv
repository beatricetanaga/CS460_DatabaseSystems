I had heard such high reviews from several people about the atmosphere, but it stank to high heaven. I didn't order anything to drink but my food was really good. Had the St. Panciro Chicken sandwich. It came on a great big chibata bread bun and the chicken was grilled nicely with jiucy tomatoes and not-to-leafy lettuce. Mixed in was a spicey sour cream and the softest avocados I have ever had. I love avocados on a sandwich and they were wonderful with the chicken. The sweet potato fries were delicious as well, they came with a hot, spicey dipping sauce that was indeed hot and spicey! Make sure you have a glass of water. It was a good experience for what we were looking for for the evening but I cannot say I would go back. Maybe if I was feeling hipster but the smell really turned me off.`,,,,,,,,
